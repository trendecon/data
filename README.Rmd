# trendEcon data repository

We construct economic indicators for Switzerland, based on Google Trends data.

The data is displayed and described at: https://www.trendecon.org

The data is stored as CSV in the [`daily`](https://github.com/trendecon/data/tree/master/daily) folder.


### Example

The following code download and displays the main indicator in R:

```{r example}
data <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/trendecon/data/master/daily/trendecon_sa.csv")
tsbox::ts_plot(data)
```
